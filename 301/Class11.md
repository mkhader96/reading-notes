# Mongo and Mongoose

## Reading

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| are primarily called as Relational Databases      | are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.       |
| table based   | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores        |
| databases have predefined schema   | databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.        |
| vertically scalable   | horizontally scalable        |
| databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.   | database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.        |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- The complex query intensive environment
3. Give a real world example.
- Complex Queries
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- The hierarchical data storage
5. Give a real world example.
- JSON data
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
- SQL

1. What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
-A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how different data structures relate to each other.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- a collection of tables, each having a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Thus a table represents a collection of relationships. There is a direct correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation.
4. What is a 'schema'?
- a list of logical structures of data.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
- Derived from the word Humongos because it can store lots and lots of data on an efficient way
6. How does it work?
-  It stores data in documents rather than relational tables
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
- Collections
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB is more flexible because of the lack of structure and relations.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- Lacks in the ability to perform dynamic operations. It can't guarantee ACID properties.
