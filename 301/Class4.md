# Forms and ternary operators

This class talks about how to use the forms and ternary operators and the benefits of using them,

## Forms
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
- Components which the data inside is controlled by the component's state

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
- We should update the responses as soon as they are entered. Because then we can pass the value to other elements.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
- By changing the state of the value and using the input event handler. We should also use onChange elements to update automatically.

## Ternary Operator

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
- We would use it to turn the if statement into one line of code. The code would be easier to read and faster to write.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement?
- x===y ? console.log(true):console.log(false)
