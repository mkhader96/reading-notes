# Django

## Reading:
#### What is Django?
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

#### Installing Django
- Install an official release. This is the best approach for most users.
- Install a version of Django provided by your operating system distribution.
- Install the latest development version. This option is for enthusiasts who want the latest-and-greatest features and aren’t afraid of running brand new code. You might encounter new bugs in the development version, but reporting them helps the development of Django.

#### Django Advantages:
- Django helps you write software that is:
1. Complete
2. Versatile
3. Secure
4. Scalable
5. Maintainable
6. Portable

#### Creating a Django Project:
- `django-admin startproject mysite`

#### How Django Works Behind the Scenes
- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
- Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at times.
-  Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid consulting services.
- Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.
