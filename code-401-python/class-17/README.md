# Automation

## Reading:
### Automation
- Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention. The goal of automation is to optimize productivity by reducing the need for human intervention in a process. Automation is used in many industries and disciplines, with the largest use in the automotive industry, electronics, and chemical industry. It is also used in the design, manufacture, and operation of many kinds of robots.


### Automation in Python
- Python is a great language for automation. It has a lot of built-in functionality that makes it easy to automate tasks. For example, Python has a built-in module called `os` that lets you interact with the operating system. You can use the `os` module to create, delete, and rename files and folders. 
- You can also use the `os` module to run commands on the command line. For example, you can use the `os` module to run the `ls` command on the command line. This will list all of the files and folders in the current directory.


### shutil
- The `shutil` module provides a high-level interface for copying files and folders. It also provides functions for renaming files and folders, and for deleting files and folders. The `shutil` module is a part of the Python standard library, so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.

### Regular Expressions in Python
- Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching text patterns. They are widely used in UNIX world. A regular expression specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

### re
- The `re` module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings. The module also offers a convenience function for splitting strings using a regular expression as the delimiter.
