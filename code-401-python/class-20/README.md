# Django Models

## Reading:
#### What are Django models?
- Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models.
- Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. The definition of the model is independent of the underlying database — you can choose one of several as part of your project settings. Once you've chosen what database you want to use, you don't need to talk to it directly at all — you just write your model structure and other code, and Django handles all the dirty work of communicating with the database for you.

#### Fields
- A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.

#### COMMON FIELD ARGUMENTS
- help_text: Provides a text label for HTML forms (e.g. in the admin site), as described above.
- verbose_name: A human-readable name for the field used in field labels. If not specified, Django will infer the default verbose name from the field name.
- default: The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object, in which case the object will be called every time a new record is created.
- null: If True, Django will store blank values as NULL in the database for fields where this is appropriate (a CharField will instead store an empty string). The default is False.
- blank: If True, the field is allowed to be blank in your forms. The default is False, which means that Django's form validation will force you to enter a value. This is often used with null=True, because if you're going to allow blank values, you also want the database to be able to represent them appropriately.
- choices: A group of choices for this field. If this is provided, the default corresponding form widget will be a select box with these choices instead of the standard text field.

#### COMMON FIELD TYPES
- CharField is used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings. You must specify the max_length of the data to be stored.
- TextField is used for large arbitrary-length strings. You may specify a max_length for the field, but this is used only when the field is displayed in forms (it is not enforced at the database level).
- IntegerField is a field for storing integer (whole number) values, and for validating entered values as integers in forms.
- DateField and DateTimeField are used for storing/representing dates and date/time information (as Python datetime.date and datetime.datetime objects, respectively). These fields can additionally declare the (mutually exclusive) parameters auto_now=True (to set the field to the current date every time the model is saved), auto_now_add (to only set the date when the model is first created), and default (to set a default date that can be overridden by the user).
- EmailField is used to store and validate email addresses.
- FileField and ImageField are used to upload files and images respectively (the ImageField adds additional validation that the uploaded file is an image). These have parameters to define how and where the uploaded files are stored.
- AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. A primary key of this type is automatically added to your model if you don't explicitly specify one.
- ForeignKey is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model (e.g. a car has one manufacturer, but a manufacturer can make many cars). The "one" side of the relationship is the model that contains the "key" (models containing a "foreign key" referring to that "key", are on the "many" side of such a relationship).

# Django admin site
#### What is Django admin application?
- The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data. The admin application can also be useful for managing data in production, depending on the type of website.

#### How to create a superuser?
- `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` 
- Then entering the username, email and password for that superuser.

#### How to enter admin page?
- Run the server using:
- `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Add admin to the domain
- Enter the log in information and then you can use the admin page.
