### What is a Tree?
- A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

### Types of Trees
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- B-Tree

### Tree Terminology
- Root: The top node in a tree.
- Node: A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes. The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes. The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
- Parent: The converse notion of a child.
- Forest: A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
- Degree of a Node: The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
- Edge: The connection between one node and another.


### Tree Applications
1. Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.
2. Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
3. A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.
4. Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which are variants of the tree structure we learned above to store their data
5. Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.
