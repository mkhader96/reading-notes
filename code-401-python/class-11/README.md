# Data Visualization

## Reading:
### Matplotlib
#### What is Matplotlib?
- Matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.
#### What is IPython?
- IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.
#### What is pyplot?
- pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

### Seaborn
#### What is Seaborn?
- Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. It aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Relationship to matplotlib
- Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. It aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- Seabornâ€™s integration with matplotlib allows you to use it across the many environments that matplotlib supports, including exploratory analysis in notebooks, real-time interaction in GUI applications, and archival output in a number of raster and vector formats

### What is Bokeh?
- Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

### What is Bokeh good for?
- Interactive visualization in modern browsers
- Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps
- Expressive and versatile graphics
- Large, dynamic or streaming data
