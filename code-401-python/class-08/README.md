# Pandas

## Reading:
### Pandas - Getting Started
- Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. 
- It is a library that is used to manipulate data, and it is used a lot in data science.

#### Data suited for pandas
- Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
1. Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
2. Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
3. Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
4. Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

#### Data structures in pandas
1. Series: 1D labeled homogeneously-typed array
2. DataFrame: General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column

#### Things pandas can do
1. Load data from different file formats
2. Select subsets of the data based on labels
3. Perform operations on the data
4. Handle missing data
5. Merge and join different datasets
6. Reshape and pivot the data
7. Plot the data
