## Serverless Functions

## Reading:
### What is Serverless?
- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.

- Today every leading cloud service provider offers a serverless platform including Amazon Web Services (AWS Lambda), Microsoft Azure (Azure Functions), Google Cloud (Google Cloud Functions) and IBM Cloud (IBM Cloud Code Engine). Together serverless computing, microservices and containers form a triumvirate of technologies typically considered to be at the core of cloud-native application development.

### Pros and of Serverless
- Improved developer productivity
- Pay for execution only
- Streamlined development/DevOps cycles
- Cost-effective performance
- Usage visibility

### Cons of Serverless
- Unacceptable latency for certain applications
- Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads
- Monitoring and debugging issues
- Vendor lock-in

### Use Cases for Serverless
- Serverless and microservices
- API backends
- Data processing
- Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations
- Stream processing workloads
