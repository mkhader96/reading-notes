# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS


#### What is Next JS
- Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites.

- Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

#### Building Blocks of a Web Application
- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
- Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- Developer Experience - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.

#### What is the DOM?
- The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.

- You can use DOM methods and a programming language, such as JavaScript, to listen to user events and manipulate the DOM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the user interface. DOM manipulation allows you to not only target specific elements, but also change their style and content.

#### Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

#### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Faster UI building process
- It is a utility-first CSS framework which means we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS as in the traditional approach.

#### Advantages of Tailwind CSS:
- No more silly names for CSS classes and Id’s.
- Minimum lines of Code in CSS file.
- We can customize the designs to make the components.
- Makes the website responsive.
- Makes the changes in the desired manner.
